#
# debrebuild resolves every build dependency from snapshot.debian.org at the
# versions the record names, unpacks the .dsc, rebuilds, and checks all four
# checksums against the .buildinfo. It prints "all OK" or names what differed.
#
# Two things this works around, both debrebuild's:
#
#  - `apt-get source` is required to succeed even though the very next line
#    extracts the local .dsc and discards what was downloaded. A source archive
#    built from the files you already have satisfies it.
#  - the mmdebstrap builder cannot run nested inside a container; the dpkg
#    builder is used instead, which is why this runs in a throwaway one.
#  - the dpkg builder installs the record's Installed-Build-Depends at exactly
#    the pinned versions, and apt satisfies that by REMOVING whatever conflicts
#    -- devscripts included, which is the package debrebuild itself came from.
#    It survives because perl already loaded it, but the `dcmd` it shells out to
#    afterwards is gone, and the run dies with "Can't exec dcmd" one step before
#    the checksum comparison that is the whole point. dcmd is a POSIX sh script
#    needing only dirname and sed, so a copy under /usr/local/bin (ahead of
#    /usr/bin on PATH, and not owned by dpkg) outlives the install.
