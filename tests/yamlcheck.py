"""Check a workflow the way GitHub will, plus two estate conventions.

Three checks, all on files this repo already hands it:

1. Parse with a loader that rejects duplicate mapping keys.
2. Every `actions/checkout` step sets `persist-credentials: false`.
3. Every third-party `uses:` is pinned to a full commit SHA.

On (1): PyYAML's safe_load keeps the last of a repeated key and reports success.
GitHub's workflow parser refuses the file outright, before any job is created,
so a local safe_load check is not evidence that a workflow will run at all.

On (2): checkout writes the job token into .git/config unless told not to, and
the next thing these workflows do is build an upstream project from source.
That is third-party code with read access to the same filesystem.

On (3): a tag can be moved by whoever compromises the action's repository, and
every consumer picks it up on the next run. actions/* and pkghaus/* stay on
major tags deliberately: GitHub owns both the tag and the content a SHA would
pin, so pinning there moves trust from GitHub to GitHub.

Both conventions are checked by walking each step's OWN `with:` and `uses:`. A
fixed grep window cannot do it - measured across this estate, -A1 through -A4
each gave a different wrong answer, because a `with:` block may carry other
keys or a comment before the setting, and a wider window reaches into the next
step.

One file, copied verbatim into pkghaus/action-debian-build, pkghaus/buildinfos,
pkghaus/infrastructure and pkghaus/reproducible. There is no public home the
estate's repos can share code through; it is small and stable enough for a copy
to be the cheaper trade. Its tests live in pkghaus/action-debian-build
(tests/test-yamlcheck.sh); change it there and copy the file to the other
three.
